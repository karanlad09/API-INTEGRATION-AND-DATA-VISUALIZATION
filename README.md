Tracks and records crypto prices over a set number of intervals

Displays time-series line graphs for easy comparison

Clean and visually appealing plots using Seaborn themes

ðŸ“¦ Libraries Used:
requests â€“ for API calls

matplotlib.pyplot â€“ for plotting the graphs

seaborn â€“ for enhanced plot styling

datetime, time â€“ for timestamping and delays

ðŸ“Œ How It Works:
Defines a list of cryptocurrency IDs.

Fetches their current prices in INR from the CoinGecko API in a loop.

Stores each value along with a timestamp.
